## App Setup

### Azure Application
Go to Portal Azure, and either create an app or use an existing one.
Can be found in Azure `Active Directory` -> `App registrations` -> `New registration`

You'll then need to add the redirect URI for your enonic XP instance to your Azure application. This can be found in the `Authentication` section of your app. Add a new Web platform and then add your url there, the url will most likely look something like `https://${domain}/admin/tool/_/idprovider/${nameOfIdProvider}`. You can add multiple redirect URIs if necessary.

If you want to auto import the users AD groups in Enonic you have to add some API permissions as well:
* Directory.Read.All
* Directory.ReadWrite.All
* Directory.AccessAsUser.All

[Graph API Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-memberof?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)

### Enonic XP
Install the Azure AD ID Provider app if you haven't already

Open up the User manage interface and add a new Id Provider. Give this Id Provider a name, and check that the path name of the Id Provider is the same as the last part of the redirect URI added to your application in Azure.

Add the Azure AD ID Provider to the `Application` field and press the small pencil to open up the settings.
* Tentant ID can be found in the overview page on your app in Azure as `Directory (tenant) ID`.
* Client ID can be found in the overview page on your app in Azure as `Application (client) ID`.
* Logout url is where you want to send the user if they press the logout button in XP. For Azure AD you'd most likely send them to the azure ad logout url, with your redirect url as a param. Remember to url encode the redirect url https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2F or see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc#send-a-sign-out-request for more info. You can also omit the post_logout_redirect_uri, and the app will try to make an educated guess, but this in not recommended.
* Client Secret has to be made in the `Certificates & secrets` section under your application in Azure.
* If you want to change the Azure AD -> Enonic XP user mapping, do so in the User Mappings (most likely not necessary).
* Remember to add the API permissions listed above if you want to create and update groups in Enonic XP based on the groups in Azure AD.
* If your Enonic XP server instance is hosted on https, you'll most likely need to check the `Force the redirect uri to use https`, since XP itself doesn't know that it is using https if it's behind a reverse proxy of some sort.

### Group Filtering
If you don't want to import all the users groups from Azure AD, it's possible to use group filters to accomplish this.

You can add multiple filters. Each filter takes 3 parameters:
`property`: This is the property that comes from the MemberOf graphApi for each group. [List of properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties)
`regexp`: Which Regular Expression to run on the property
`and`: If you want to AND this with the previous filter.

Example:
`property`: description
`regexp`: \\\$XP\\\$
`and`: false

`property`: displayName
`regexp`: ^XP
`and`: false

`property`: id
`regexp`: 12345-12345-12345-12345
`and`: false

`property`: visibility
`regexp`: Public
`and`: true

This will then include groups with descriptions marked with `$XP$`, or groups with a display name starting with `XP`, or the group with id `12345-12345-12345-12345  ` where visibility is `Public`. So it's divided into 3 checks: 1 OR 2 OR (3 AND 4)

### Configuration from .cfg file

As of v1.3.0 it's possible to override the settings entered in the form in the users app and instead configure the id provider with a CFG file:

- If _<enonic-home>/config/com.enonic.app.azureadidprovider.cfg_ exists and contains settings under the .cfg key(s) `idprovider.<idprovidername>.*` (even just one key like that), then the data-layer configs from the form defined in _src/main/resources/idprovider/idprovider.xml_ will be ignored and the settings defined in _com.gravitondigital.app.azureadidprovider.cfg_ will be used instead.

- Keys in the .cfg file correspond to the names (`<input name="*"`) in _idprovider.xml_, but with a prefix: `idprovider.<idprovidername>.` So for example, when the _idprovider.xml_ defines the name `forceHttpsOnRedirectUri`, an ID provider ("userstore") named `myidp` can define that value in _com.gravitondigital.app.azureadidprovider.cfg_ like this: `idprovider.myidp.forceHttpsOnRedirectUri=true`.

- Nested data structures are supported as a dot-separated syntax after the IDP name in the keys. The structure from the form/data layer should be mirrored exactly when setting up the .cfg file. For example, the input `port` under the item-set `proxy` would be defined as `idprovider.myidp.proxy.port=7000`.

- Arrays of items are also supported, defined by adding index numbers (consecutive starting from 0) to the path below the parent. For example, the item-set `groupFilter` has `occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0"`, so many sub-items can be added below that. Each sub-item must have the fields `groupProperty` and `regexp`. Define an array of groupFilter subitems in the .cfg like this:

```
idprovider.myidp.groupFilter.0.groupProperty=foo
idprovider.myidp.groupFilter.0.regexp=^foo$
idprovider.myidp.groupFilter.1.groupProperty=bar
idprovider.myidp.groupFilter.1.regexp=^bar$
```
...etc

- Since values containing placeholders on the syntax`${}` can cause unwanted behavior in .cfg files, replace the `$` with a double `@`. For example, `idprovider.myidp.user.displayName=@@{given_name} @@{family_name} &lt;@@{upn}&gt;`

- If _com.gravitondigital.app.azureadidprovider.cfg_ contains `autoinit=true`, the app will look all idprovider names declared in the file on startup and create them if they don't already exist, with the declared .cfg settings.For example, `idprovider.myfirstidp.someKey=someValue` and `idprovider.anotheridp.anotherKey=anotherValue` will declare two idproviders named `myfirstidp` and `anotheridp`.


## Events

The following events can be listed after using event library:

| Event type                |      Description       |
|---------------------------|:----------------------:|
| `custom.azure.user.login` |      User logs in      |
| `custom.azure.user.modify`| Local user is modified |
| `custom.azure.user.create`| Local user is created  |

The *Login* event passes an object as parameter describing the user with these fields:

 - `type`
 - `key`
 - `displayName`
 - `disabled`
 - `email`
 - `login`
 - `idProvider`

The **Create** event passes an object as parameter with the following fields:

 - `idProvider`
 - `name`
 - `displayName`
 - `email`

_Example:_

```javascript
const eventLib = require("/lib/xp/event")

eventLib.listener({
  type: "custom.azure.user.login",
  callback: function(event) {
    log.info(event.data.email);
  }
})
```
